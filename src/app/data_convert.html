  <h2>1	Department of Computer Science</h2>
  <p>The Department of Computer Science of the University of Ruhuna was established in 1997 fulfilling a long-standing need of the University. The department presently offers course units of 30 credits (1/3 of the B.Sc. General Degree programme) in Computer Science for the B.Sc. General Degree programme for 120 students per batch.
    The Department of Computer Science commenced Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) Degree in 2010. The main aim of the degree programme is to prepare the undergraduates for a career in Computer Science and Information Technology, which is one of the major driving forces of the economic development of Sri Lanka. This degree programme will cover all aspects of Computer Science including modern computer languages and systems.
