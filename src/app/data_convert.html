  <h1>1	Department of Computer Science</h1>
  <p>The Department of Computer Science of the University of Ruhuna was established in 1997 fulfilling a long-standing need of the University. The department presently offers course units of 30 credits (1/3 of the B.Sc. General Degree programme) in Computer Science for the B.Sc. General Degree programme for 120 students per batch.
    The Department of Computer Science commenced Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) Degree in 2010. The main aim of the degree programme is to prepare the undergraduates for a career in Computer Science and Information Technology, which is one of the major driving forces of the economic development of Sri Lanka. This degree programme will cover all aspects of Computer Science including modern computer languages and systems.

      <p>Evaluation Method: ontinuous Assessments 40% and End Semester Examina- tion (Level I Semester II) 60%</p>
      <h3>Note: Continuous Assessments 40 Marks</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Students are assessed based on three practical assessments in Level I Semester I. If a student completes all three assessments, only two assessments with best marks are counted towards the final grade of the course unit.</li>
      <li>If a student misses an assessment and fails to provide an acceptable reason zero mark is allocated for the particular assessment. If a student is unable to sit for the final examination or fails the final examination, marks earned for continuous assessments will be carried forward to the final grade of the repeat examination.</li>
      <li>Under any circumstances if a student is unable to earn 10 marks out of 40 marks (25%) from the continuous assessments component, he/she must do at least two continuous assessments in the following year.</li>

  <h2>1.12 Examinations - BCS Degree Programmes</h2>
  <h3>Bachelor of Computer Science (General) Degree</h3>
  <p>The Bachelor of Computer Science (General) Degree will include six semesters during which students will have to follow Compulsory Course Units (CCU) offered by respective departments and elective or optional Course Units (OCU). The Bachelor of Computer Science (General) Degree Examination will consist of end of semester examinations for theory and practical Course Units.</p>

  <h3>Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) Degree</h3>
  <p>The duration of the Honours degree programme is four academic years (eight semesters) inclusive of Level I, II and III of the BCS (General) degree.During the four academic years of the degree programme, a student shall complete course units aggregating to 120 credits with at least 30 credits from the fourth academic year of the Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) Degree courses.The Honours degree consists of examinations at the end of each semester or at the end of course unit for research project</p>

  <h3>1.12.1 Attendance</h3>
  <p>To be eligible to sit for an examination of a theory or practical course unit, there should be minimum attendance of 80%. If a student fails to meet this requirement for a particular course unit, he or she will be considered to have failed in that course unit (see section 14.3.1 for further details).</p>

  <h3>1.12.2 Examination Criteria</h3>
  <h4>Evaluation Methods</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Theory examination (written/oral)</li>
    <li>Practical examination</li>
    <li>Continuous assessment</li>
    <li>Assignment</li>
    <li>Report</li>
    <li>Presentation</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Grading System</h4>
  <p>Awarding of grades for course units will be done according to the grading system given in the Table in section 14.2.</p>

  <h4>Pass in a Course Unit</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A candidate who obtains grade C or better for a Course Unit will be considered to have passed in that Course Unit.</li>
    <li>If a student fails to complete a Course Unit, grade of E will be given unless an acceptable reason is produced. In the event of given reason is accepted by the Senate on the recommendation of the Faculty Board, he/she will be considered as sitting for the first time in a subsequent attempt for that course unit.</li>
    <li>A student who obtains a C- or lower grade in a particular Course Unit, may re-sit the examination in respect of that Course Unit for the purpose of improving its grade within the stipulated period. The highest grade a student can obtain is C, which is in this instance equivalent to GPA 2.0. In the event a student obtains a lower grade, he/she will be entitled to the previous grade. Repeat candidates are not entitled to attend the lectures/practical classes of the Course Unit in which he/she has failed.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Verification of Marks</h4>
  <p>See section 14.2.5 for details.</p>
  
  <h3>1.12.3 Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS General) Degree Requirements</h3>
  <p>A candidate shall be eligible for the conferment of the Bachelor of Computer Science (General) Degree after the successful completion of all requirements within a maximum period of five academic years from the date of entry to the University of Ruhuna as specified below.<br>A student shall be deemed to have passed the Bachelor of Computer Science (General) Degree Examination if he/she has obtained</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a minimum of 90 credits</li>
    <li>grades of C or better aggregating to a minimum of 60% credits of Computer Science CCUS</li>
    <li>grades of C or better aggregating to a minimum of 60% credits of Mathematics CCUS</li>
    <li>grades of C or better aggregating to a minimum of 60% credits of OCUs</li>
    <li>a grade C or better for Industry Based Project/Industry Placement course unit</li>
    <li>Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.00 or more.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>GPA will be calculated as follows:</p>
  <p>GPA = (Grade Point Value for a Course Unit) * (Number of credits of that Course Unit) / Total number of credits</p>

  <h4>Award of Honours</h4>
  <p>A student who has satisfied conditions given above is eligible for an award of an Honours degree if he/she completes the requirements indicated below within three academic years from the date of first registered securing grades of C or better aggregating to a minimum of 75 credits.</p>
  <ol>
